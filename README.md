# Thermodynamic PCA Simulation

This project simulates thermodynamic systems with the goal of generating interpretable data for dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## 📘 Overview

We simulate a set of artificial chemical species, each characterized by discrete energy levels. Using statistical mechanics, we calculate:

- Canonical partition functions
- Boltzmann probabilities
- Average energy
- Entropy (optional/coming soon)

These features are organized into a dataset suitable for PCA to explore underlying patterns and correlations.

Absolutely—great idea to include that table in the README. Here’s a polished version of it with concise column titles, ready for Markdown:

### 🧠 Conceptual Mapping

This project builds an interpretable dataset for PCA using thermodynamic simulations. Here’s how standard data analysis concepts map to this simulation:

Role	In This Project
Samples	Chemical species
Features	Thermodynamic quantities (e.g., energy, entropy, partition function)

## 🧪 Motivation

This project serves as a conceptual "curveball" dataset—a synthetic yet physically meaningful system—designed to help understand PCA in the context of thermodynamics and statistical physics. It draws inspiration from applications in biophysics, especially neural systems where energy and entropy play key roles.

## 🔧 Tools

- **Language**: MATLAB (Python version may follow)
- **Math**: Statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, linear algebra
- **Libraries**: None required for base MATLAB implementation

## 📁 Structure
`code/       % MATLAB scripts and functions
latex/      % Overleaf documents or exported PDFs
notes/      % Conceptual notes, derivations, ideas`

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Implement entropy calculation
- Extend to multiple temperatures or chemical potentials
- Compare synthetic data to real open-access datasets
- Perform PCA and visualize results
